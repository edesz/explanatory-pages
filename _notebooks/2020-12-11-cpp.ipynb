    "### Background\n",
    "The hypothetical client is in the car-loan financing business and targets customers looking to purchase a vehicle from the emarketplace cars.com. The client only serves two US cities - Austin, TX and Seattle, WA - and immediately surrounding areas (within a 20 mile range of a highly populated zip code in each city - [78745 in Austin](http://localistica.com/usa/tx/zipcodes/most-populated-zipcodes/) and [99208 and 99052 in Seattle](http://localistica.com/usa/wa/zipcodes/most-populated-zipcodes/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently a financing package is developed using in-house business rules taking into account listing attributes such as exterior styling, transmission speed, tank capacity, etc. These factors are used to approximate a listing price. Even through cars.com lists a price, the client needs their own approximation since it is their financing that will be offered to the customer. At present, the client focuses on new-vehicle financing only, up to a price of `$`45,000, and so wants to market itself as a competitor to cars.com for financing listings on that platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "The client develops an estimate of the value (price) of the listing and develops a financing package based on this price, using knowledge of the field. Based on this package, the client decides if they want to proceed with the purchase. If so, they'll buy the car from cars.com but take the financing package from our client and cover the difference in estimated and true price themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client has noticed that customers are more aggressively re-negotiating financing terms for listings whose prices are under-estimated. This results in them (client) needing to re-structure the financing and make a more generous offer than warranted in order to keep the prospective customer happy and willing to proceed with purchase through them rather than through a competitor. This re-structuring represents a loss to the client. It is also required for over-estimated prices but, with less pressure from the customer, a more reasonable re-structuring is possible without incurring such a heavy loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the client wants to explore the use of ML to cut down on their re-structuring losses. They hope the result is fewer under-predicted prices thereby cutting their re-structuring losses. As factors important to predicting the price are currently used to develop a financing package, the client wants the ML price prediction service to return interpretable predictors. To this end, they are on the lookout for a ML-based pricing service to (a) estimate car listing prices and (b) use the factors identified as being important predictors of the price to build their financing package. If they find a suitable service, they will replace all in-house business rule-based pricing with the ML-based approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Costs Involved\n",
    "From historical experience in dealing with customers, the client has observed that the re-structuring problem appears when the client's estimated price is different from the true price by more than `$`5,000. So, they are willing to pay 15% of the true price for predictions within the acceptable (tolerable) range of `$`5,000 above or below the true price. However, they will charge the pricing service for intolerable errors (larger than `$`5,000) as explained above - 40% for intolerable under- and 10% for intolerable over-predictions of the price.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "This project develops a first version of such an ML based service and estimates the return earned (or lost) from developing an ML-based listing pricing service to make predictions on listings from cars.com. The focus is on using the Python programming language for the ML development workflow covering data acquisition to generatiion of price predictions. Deploying the developed ML model is out of scope for this prototype project."

Before starting this, the data was split into an overall training and testing split, following an 80%-20% division. This overall training data (80% of overall data) was used to train the ML model. After this was completed, the unseen 20% of the data (the testing data) was only used for evaluating the performance on the trained ML model. If the test set was used to score the ML model's predictions, then the ML model might learn its best parameters based exclusively on the testing data and would not generalize well to out-of-sample (or unseen) data.\n",

After several iterations of ML model training, the best model is selected and then trained on the overall training split.

This was also noted during the exploratory data analysis section where the miles per gallon was found to be the sole continuous variable with a clear linear relationship to the listing price.

    "After filtering to remove outliers from listings scraped from cars.com (where the max. prices is capped at `$`45,000), selecting features and choosing between four types of linear regression models, the best ML model was trained on approx. 1,800 listings from cars.com and made 428 predictions on data not seen during ML model development. The best ML model here returns an RMSE, on the predictions, of approx. `$`4,900 (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.61). This meets the goal for this project. The factors most important to the model;s ability to predict unseen data are MPG, Drivetrain, Transmission Speed and Interior design, the latter three of which are categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the best linear ML model found here is deployed as part of a price prediction service to make these predictions on unseen data, then offering such a service will cost us (rather than generate returns) due to the heavily penalized under-predicted prices at the current level of performance."

    "There are several next steps that can be followed in order to attempt at improving the current ML model performance. A few options related to the feature engineering might warrant consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "A logical starting point is to look into improving results on the worst under-predicted listings. These were predominantly from WA state and were priced above the price of listings used to train the ML model. Adding a market indicator as a proxy for asset valuation could be explored to account for the pattern of these errors in relation to listing price. Additng demographic data that separates the two states, in the vicinity of the client's targeted cities, could be explored to account for the dependence on the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few high-cardinality categorical features were left out. These could be aggregated so that infrequently occurring categories are binned together. This could help reduce the cardinality of the feature while also making the feature usable without causing an explosion in the number of features after encoding. Ofcourse, the drawback is that some of the predictive power of the binned categories could be lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the dearth of numerical features linearly related to the listing price, scraping new vehicle attributes from cars.com (for the same listings) could be pursued. Also, text attributes have not been used, such as a description of the vehicle. One could attempt to extract named entities or topics from this text and augment the exising data."
